# CPP_Modules

In this projects we explore the basics of CPP in different short "modules" comprised of a variety of small exercises, each meant to deepen our understanding of specific concepts

The mains can be found at https://github.com/42Curriculum/test_mains 

Projects must be compiled using : clang++

While they are meant to teach us C++, I took some liberties with certains exercises and turned them into small games for my own amusement...
